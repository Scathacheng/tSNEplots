# tSNEplots
## Description ##
An R script for automatically creating coloured tSNE plots. Follow the instructions within the R script to execute.

There are two versions of this script. In the main script (tSNEplots.R), the colour scale for each sample is handled independently. In the new script (tSNEplots_global_scaling.R) the colour, X, and Y scales are 'global', so for any given marker the maximum and minimum will be the same between samples.

This script accepts .csv files as input. A version to read straight from .fcs files will follow soon.
